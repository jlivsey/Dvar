Questions
---------

Relationship bw tally of variables that changed as they relate to the
margins that were included.
  - Also look at this by threshold of change

When an interior cell changes, how often is a corresponding margin that contains
that cell exactly satisfied?




4 boxplots:
  1. changed interior cells
  2. unchanged interior cells
  3. changed margins
  4. unchagnges margins

Contribution of absolutle value to L1 regression if Xhat = XDP for margins
and Xhat = eps for interior cells.



looking at results for margins of L1 regression.
We have the following categories to consider:
1. True maginal sum (not visable to L1 regression)
2. Sum of interior cells DP value (starting point of sorts)
3. DP marginal value (sum of 1. and laplace noise)
4. Estimated marginal value (sum of interior estimates)


To Do
------

1A. go through sim6way function and clarify eps vs bpar !!!!
    as eps goes up bpar should go down.



1. Consider "starting error" problem for margins that are Changed
  (absolute error != 0)

2. When is L1-regression solution unique? do our solvers check this?


Given sparse cell with large absoulte error, look at values of "neighborhood"
cells. Conjecture: they might be large and providing some room for
redistributing in the L1 regression.

Scale neighborhoods slightly to see if we can mitigate this effect?

Scaling of epsMod - can we recover the proper scale factor for 20210601-sim and 20210623-sim. Need to think about epsMod <- epsMod / sum(epsMod) line of sim6way.r code


One feature to consider for future factorial simulation runs:
- What if we start to include county and state level margins earlier in the
  nesting structure.
  * This gets to answer the questions "what is the optimal eps schedule"
