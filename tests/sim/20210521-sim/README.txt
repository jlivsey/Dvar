For the following set of simulations we move outward in a nested structure from the no margins case.
This follows Table 2 in the write up, starting in the top-right with only detailed-tract.

Nested Structure:
-----------------
non = just detailed at tract level 
tr1 = just own/rent margins                    (86 margins)
tr2 = own/rent and votingAge x hisp x cenRace  (344 margins)
tr3 = all tract margins in Table 2             (1548 margins)
cnt = all tract and county margins	       (1800 margins)		
all = all margins                              (1872 margins)
