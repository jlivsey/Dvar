## Purpose

This sim is investigating the case where detailed cells noise is very large
relative to the margins.
It will be run in two different ways.

1. The detailed-tract query will be given very low allocation of the overall
epsilon budget.

1. The noise level for the detailed-tract will be drawn independent of the eps
budget and schedule from a very large bpar.
